		<li><br>What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) : Hypertext Transfer protocol is an application-layer protocol used to transmit hypermedia documents. Its main purpose is to communicate between web browsers and web servers.</li>


		<li><br>Why is HTTP called a stateless protocol?:
		The server does not keep any data between two requests</li>

		<li><br>Describe the three phases of establishing a session using client-server protocols such as HTTP: Requests are sent by one entity(the user-agent). Each request is sent to a server. The server answers back which is called a response. 
		</li>


		<li><br>Describe the parameters on a get and post request: They are HTTP methods that define the operation the client wants to perform. Client uses GET to fetch a resource. Uses POST to post the value of an HTML form.</li>

						
		<li><br>What are the HTTP response status code and What do the HTTP status codes, 200, and 404 indicate? : 
		Response status code indicates if the request has been successful or not.
		Status code 200 means that the request is successful , 400 means it is unsuccessful</li>

		<li><br>What are HTTP cookies? Give an example. : Http cookies are a small amount of data that a server sends to the users web browser. For example they can record and analyse user behavior.</li>

		<li><br>Why are cookies a security issue?: Cookies can be stolen which can lead to the the thief accessing the authenticated users session.</li>

		<li><br>Describe session hijacking and XSS :
		Session hijacking involves cookies being stolen which leads to a authenticated user's session being hijacked. XSS (cross-site scripting) is a clientside code injection attack where the attacker aims to execute malicious scripts in a web browser.</li>

		<li><br>Describe Cross-site request forgery(CSRF) : CSRF involves a request not being what it seems. For example a image could actually be a request to your bank servers.</li>

		<li><br>What are Cross-site HTTP requests (CORS) and what requests use CORS? : CORS are a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell a browser to let a web application running at one domain have access to resources from a different server.</li>
